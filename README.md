## MMRelay Plugin Template

Fork this repo and create a new one with the name of your plugin, rename `example_plugin.py` to the name of your plugin and go from there.

For more information on the basics creating community plugins see the [MMRelay Community Plugin Development Guide](https://github.com/geoffwhittington/meshtastic-matrix-relay/wiki/Community-Plugin-Development-Guide).


## Code Quality Tools
I recommend making use of [trunk.io](https://trunk.io)'s code quality tools to help you with your code. They are free for open source projects.

This repo has been initialized with [Code Quality Tools](https://docs.trunk.io/code-quality) and the configuration files are located in the `.trunk` folder in this repository.

To use this functionality you will need to install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (or [VS Codium](https://vscodium.com/)) and the [Code Quality Tools CLI](https://docs.trunk.io/code-quality/setup-and-installation/initialize-trunk).

The rest is handled automatically in code editor as you work.
